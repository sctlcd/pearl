[Let me show you!](https://sctlcd-pearl3.herokuapp.com/)
<br />
<br />
**Warning**
<br />
Because of an issue relative to submitting a form with an uploaded image in my deployed environment I did set up the image field in the gallery model as not required for limiting the impact of the issue which has been solved just before my project deadline submission. I set up initially the gallery image field as required. I will set it back to required in the future.

### Why this project? <a name="whyThisProject"></a>

This project is part of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full Stack Software Development studies, the **Full Stack Frameworks With Django** module. The objective of this milestone project is building a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset, setting up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service.

My modern responsive e-commerce arts and crafts supplies site is built using HTML, CSS, Material Design for Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Django, Python, PostgreSQL.

### Design <a name="design"></a>

I did choose a warm, joyful and energetic orange ![#fc9601](https://placehold.it/15/fc9601/fc9601) `#fc9601` combined with sober and reliable colors ranging between off-white ![#fafafa](https://placehold.it/15/fafafa/fafafa) `#fafafa` and black ![#000](https://placehold.it/15/000/000) `#000` with shades of grey (more color details in [Color Scheme](#colorScheme) section).
<br />
I first selected my [logo](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/craft_3079199) from Flaticon(https://www.flaticon.com) which I customized in [Pearl logo](https://github.com/sctlcd/pearl/blob/master/media/logo/pearl-min.png).
<br />
Then I chose [images](https://github.com/sctlcd/pearl/tree/master/media) relative to arts and crafts and creative activities which fit well in my color scheme and in the space allocated.
<br />
I finally selected the main home page image, a [fire spin](https://github.com/sctlcd/pearl/blob/master/media/home/hero_image/hero-image-background-min.jpg) picture, as I found it absolutely stunning, very eye-catchy and intriguing. Catching customers/visitors' attention and raising their interest and curiosity are, I believe, a good recipe for new visitors as much as for regular customers of an e-commerce site.  
<br />
I decided to implement a customers' gallery and offering the possibility to share your own piece of art while getting inspiration from other customers' art work. I believe this feature is a very interesting one as it involves the customers/makes the customers participate in the website building. They are actors, in a way, of the gallery page building and its content.

### Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

I have used Balsamiq Wireframes for my wireframes because:

- Code Institute have provided all students a free licence. I got to use this software a few years ago and I am pretty happy to get the chance to use it again.
- The simplicity, rapidity and ease of use by focusing on structure and content.
- My wireframes for this project can be found here in the [wireframes](https://github.com/sctlcd/pearl/tree/master/design/wireframes/pearl-wireframes.bmpr) sub-directory.

Remark: There is a bug at the opening of the balsamiq file: in each page on the mobile version, there are icon overlays on the right corner.

It's highly recommended to work in a virtual environment, but not absolutely required.

In order to run this project locally on your own system, you will need the following installed (as a bare minimum):

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads) to run the application.
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing) to install all app requirements.
- [GIT](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) for cloning and version control.

Next, there's a series of steps to take in order to proceed with local deployment:

- Clone this GitHub repository by either clicking the green "*Clone or download*" button above in order to download the project as a zip-file (remember to unzip it first), or by entering the following command into the Git CLI terminal:
    - `git clone https://github.com/sctlcd/pearl.git`
- Navigate to the correct file location after unpacking the files.
    - `cd <path to folder>`
- Create a `.env` file with your own credentials. An example *.env* file can be found here ([.env_sample](project/.env_sample)).
    - *Note: the example .env file contains environmental variables for both local and remote deployment. (see below for remote deployment details)*
- Install all requirements from the [requirements.txt](project/requirements.txt) file using this command:
    - `sudo -H pip3 -r requirements.txt`
- In the IDE terminal, use the following command to launch the Django project:
    - `python manage.py runserver`
- The Django server should be running locally now on **http://127.0.0.1:8000** (or similar). If it doesn't automatically open, you can copy/paste it into your browser of choice.
- When you run the Django server for the first time, it should create a new *SQLite3* database file: **db.sqlite3**
- Next, you'll need to make migrations to create the database schema:
    - `python manage.py makemigrations`
    - `python manage.py migrate`
- In order to access the Django *Admin Panel*, you must generate a superuser:
    - `python manage.py createsuperuser`
    - (assign an admin username, email, and secure password)

Once the database migrations and superuser have been successfully completed, Django should migrate the existing *migrations.py* files from each app to configure the following relational schema:

### Deployment – Live Website <a name="deploymentLiveWebsite"></a>

This site is currently deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using the **master** branch on GitHub. Once you have the project setup locally, you can proceed to deploy it remotely with the following steps:

- Create a **requirements.txt** file so Heroku can install the required dependencies to run the app:
    - `sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
    - The *requirements.txt* file for this project can be found here: [requirements.txt](https://github.com/sctlcd/pearl/blob/master/requirements.txt)
- Create a **Procfile** to tell Heroku what type of application is being deployed using *pearl*, and how to run it:
    - `echo web: gunicorn main.wsgi:application > Procfile`
    - The *Procfile* for this project can be found here: [Procfile](https://github.com/sctlcd/pearl/blob/master/Procfile)
- Sign up for a free Heroku account, create your project app, and click the **Deploy** tab, at which point you can *Connect GitHub* as the Deployment Method, and select *Enable Automatic Deployment*.
- In the Heroku **Resources** tab, navigate to the *Add-Ons* section and search for **Heroku Postgres**. Make sure to select the free *Hobby* level. This will allow you to have a remote database instead of using the local sqlite3 database, and can be found in the Settings tab. You'll need to update your *.env* file with your new *database-url* details.
- In the Heroku **Settings** tab, click on the *Reveal Config Vars* button to configure environmental variables. You will need to copy/paste all of the *.env* key value pairs into the config variables, but please omit the *development=1* variable; this is only for local deployment.
- Your app should be successfully deployed to Heroku at this point, but you're not quite finished yet!
- Update the *settings.py* file to connect the remote database using this Python package: `dj_database_url`
- Re-build the migrations and create a superuser to your new remote database using the instructions in the *local deployment* section above.
- Sign up for a free [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account in order to host your *staticfiles* and *media* files. From the **S3 buckets** section, you'll need to create a new unique bucket. Follow these next steps to complete the setup:

**Permissions** > **CORS configuration**:

```
[
  {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
          "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
          "GET"
      ],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
          "*"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```

**Permissions** > **Bucket Policy**:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<x>/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

*! IMPORTANT ! - on the **Resource** line above, be sure to replace `<x>` with your **AWS bucket arn** details, but retain the `/*` at the end.* It should look similar to this:
    - `"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"`

- From here, you'll need to navigate to the **IAM** section of AWS.
    - Create a *New Group* and be sure to select your existing S3 Bucket details to attach.
    - Create a *New Policy* and a *New User* in the IAM section as well, then attach these to the Group you just built.
- In your CLI-terminal, you should now be able to push the static files to AWS if everything is configured properly using this command:
    - `python manage.py collectstatic`
- Sign up for a free [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account. Navigate to the **Developers** section, and click on **API Keys**. You should have two confidential keys which need to be added to your *.env* file, as well as your Heroku config vars. These keys are:
    - `Publishable Key`: **pk_test_key**
    - `Secret Key`: **sk_test_key**

Congratulations! Your project should be completely setup and ready for remote deployment!
